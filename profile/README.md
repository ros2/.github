# About 
The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a set of software libraries and tools that help you build robot applications. From drivers to state-of-the-art algorithms, and with powerful developer tools, ROS has what you need for your next robotics project. And it's all open source. Full project details on [ROS.org](https://ros.org/)

# Getting Started 
Looking to get started with ROS? Our [installation guide is here](https://www.ros.org/blog/getting-started/). Once you've installed ROS start by learning some [basic concepts](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Concepts/Basic.html) and take a look at our [beginner tutorials](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Tutorials/Beginner-CLI-Tools.html).
